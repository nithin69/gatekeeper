<h3>Sthalapuranam of the Temple:</h3>
<p>
In so far as Sthalapuranam of this Temple is concerned, there is no authentic information. It is learnt that Sri Kanaka Maha Lakshmi Ammavaru is the family deity of the then ?Rajas of Visakhapatnam?. The locality where the idol was found is called ?Burujupeta? since it was near ?Buruju? of the ?Fort? of the then Rajas.
<br>
According to local story, in the year 1912, the Idol of Godess Sri Kanaka Maha Lakshmi Ammavaru was taken out from the well and it was installed at the center of the road i.e., amidst the Municipal lane. The Municipal authorities, for the purpose of widening the road, have shifted the Idol from admidst the road to a corner of the road. During which period i.e., in the year 1917 the dangerous contagious disease `Plauge? spread over the town and so many deaths occurred in Visakhapatnam village. The people of Visakhapatnam were afraid of the incident and thought the devastation was due to shifting of idol of goddess `Sri Kanaka Maha Lakshmi? and therefore, re-erected Ammavari Idol to its original place i.e., at the center of the road as it existed now. Owing to re-erection, the `Plague? disease was cured and normalcy was restored. With this, the villagers have a staunch belief that it is all due to miracle of Goddess., and thus from then onwards the Villagers used to worship the Goddess by peforming sevas with much devotion. Further, the people of the vicinity have strong belief that ` Sri Kanaka Maha Lakshmi Ammavaru? is the `MOTHER OF TRUTH? and will always bless her devotees by fulfilling their requirements. The lady devotees have staunch belief that the Goddess bless them with ?Sumangali?. The devotees of Goddess bring their newly born babies to the temple and keep them at the feet of Goddess and seek blessings.</p>
